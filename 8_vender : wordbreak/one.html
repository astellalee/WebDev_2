    <p>World building requires underlying logic and design consistency. Immersive experiences should aim for consistent physics, a continuous, persistent history, logical variations in treatments of elements (visual and behaviorial), and predictable interaction mechanics. Tying these aspects together crafts usable, compelling, believable worlds where users can dive deep. Interrogate every detail; tweak and rationalize every decision according to how it would manifest specifically in this world. Always look for innovative ways to empower the user to do more with less effort. At the end of the day, the goal should be to improve the way that people work. The frameworks and patterns for AR/VR user interaction are still in their infancy, but they are growing rapidly. Experiment with established as well as original methods of interaction. Know your target user and understand their expectations and habits. Learn about their current working environment. Be conscious of their attitude towards new technology, experience with AR/VR, and the steps that theyâ€™ll need to take in order to adopt your solution.</p>
